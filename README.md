## Context
Imagine driving through town and a coupon is delivered to your cell phone for a restaurant near where you are driving. Would you accept that coupon and take a short detour to the restaurant? Would you accept the coupon but use it on a subsequent trip? Would you ignore the coupon entirely? What if the coupon was for a bar instead of a restaurant? What about a coffee house? Would you accept a bar coupon with a minor passenger in the car? What about if it was just you and your partner in the car? Would weather impact the rate of acceptance? What about the time of day?

## Business goal
What are the factors that determine whether a driver accepts the coupon once it is delivered to them? How would you determine whether a driver is likely to accept a coupon? 
<br/><br/>
**Determining these factors would allow us to use more target approaches to increase coupon acceptance rate for our establishment partners.**

## Table of findings - Concluding hypothesis

|No. | Findings | Remarks |
|:--- |:---	  |:---      |
|1.  | Vehicles from Ford, Chevy & Toyota are the most popular as these 3 are the most popular manufacturers respectively. |      |		
|2.  | Their diesel vehicles are the highest priced amongst all the types they sell. |      |
|3.  | Most popular vehicles are SUVs & sedans. |      |
|4.  | Electric and hybrid vehicles from Jeep are the highest priced vehicles. |      |
|5.  | The condition of the car matters the most. Only cars that are in 'like new', 'excellent' or 'good condition' hold any value. |      |
|6.  | Cars that are dated in the last 5 or so years hold the most value. Anything older drops price significantly. |      |
|7.  | Only cars with clean title status have reasonable value. |      |
|8.  | White color cars seems to be the most popular. |      |

## Recommendations to client
1. Stock up on diesel SUV & sedans from Ford, Chevy & Toyota respectively.
2. Ensure they are in 'like new', 'excellent' or 'good condition' in that order of preference.
3. Ensure that they are dated within the last 5 years.
4, Where possible, try to pick up cars that are white or black. Avoid cars with odd colors such as purple.
