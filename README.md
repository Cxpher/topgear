## Context
My goal is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive in order to provide clear recommendations to my client -- a used car dealership -- as to what consumers value in a used car.

## Business goal
What are the factors that determine whether a driver accepts the coupon once it is delivered to them? How would you determine whether a driver is likely to accept a coupon? 
<br/><br/>
**Determining these factors would allow us to use more target approaches to increase coupon acceptance rate for our establishment partners.**

## Table of findings - Concluding hypothesis

|No. | Findings | Remarks |
|:--- |:---	  |:---      |
|1.  | Vehicles from Ford, Chevy & Toyota are the most popular as these 3 are the most popular manufacturers respectively. |      |		
|2.  | Their diesel vehicles are the highest priced amongst all the types they sell. |      |
|3.  | Most popular vehicles are SUVs & sedans. |      |
|4.  | Electric and hybrid vehicles from Jeep are the highest priced vehicles. |      |
|5.  | The condition of the car matters the most. Only cars that are in 'like new', 'excellent' or 'good condition' hold any value. |      |
|6.  | Cars that are dated in the last 5 or so years hold the most value. Anything older drops price significantly. |      |
|7.  | Only cars with clean title status have reasonable value. |      |
|8.  | White color cars seems to be the most popular. |      |

## Recommendations to client
1. Stock up on diesel SUV & sedans from Ford, Chevy & Toyota respectively.
2. Ensure they are in 'like new', 'excellent' or 'good condition' in that order of preference.
3. Ensure that they are dated within the last 5 years.
4, Where possible, try to pick up cars that are white or black. Avoid cars with odd colors such as purple.
